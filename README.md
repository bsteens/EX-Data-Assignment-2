# EX-Data-Assignment-2
###### Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI).

###### For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

###### Plot 1 shows that total PM.25 emissions in the United States have decreased from 1999 to 2008.
###### Plot 2 shows that total PM.25 emissions in Baltimore have decreased from 1999 to 2008.
###### Plot 3 shows that non-road, nonpoint, and on-road sources have all seen decreases in emissions from 1999 to 2008. The point source saw a significant increase until 2005 at which point it decreases again by 2008 to just above the starting values.
###### Plot 4 shows that coal combustion-related sources have decreased from 1999 to 2008.
###### Plot 5 shows that emissions from motor vehicles have decreased in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008.
###### Plot 6 shows that Los Angeles has shown greater changes in motor vehicle emissions.
